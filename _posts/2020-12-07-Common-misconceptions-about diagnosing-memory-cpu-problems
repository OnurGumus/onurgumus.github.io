# Common misconceptions about diagnosing memory cpu-problems

As a developer, diagnosing problems is an important skill, almost as important as our developer skills. But misdiagnosing things can lead to more problems. Let's address some common misconceptions about them:

## Mistake #1: I use task manager on Windows to find out memory usage for a process

Typically on windows platform when we are asked how much memory is consumed by a process, what we do is fire-up task manager and look at:
![Task-Manager-Working-set](/assets/task-manager-working-set.png)

If you measure the memory consumption as above I have one word for you: Ouch! What you are looking at is actually **Working set** which means that's only the physical memory consumption.
But it is quite possible, significant portion of your process may not be on the physical memory but on the disk. Windows memory manager will happily put the less frequently accessed 
pages to the disk. Then what should we do? It's the commit size (or private bytes) is what we want. You could see the the private bytes for a process as below:


![Task-Manager-Commit](/assets/task-manager-commit.png)

Note the difference. Basically avoid anything that contains the term "Working Set". On Linux, you can rely on **VMEM** column with **htop**. 

The true memory consumption of a process is a complicated matter as there is the shared part of it. But Committed memory (or private bytes from perfview) and VMEM from htop 
is roughly accurate assuming you don't use things like memory mapped files.


## Mistake #2: My system has 16 GB Ram whereas my app uses around only 800 MB, so it is unlikely that I will get Out Of Memory Exception

Both Linux and Windows operating system tricks the the process such that for 64 bit-processes, the process believes it has terabytes of ram available. 
But for 32-bit processes it only has 4GB ram!! And half of it is reserved for the kernel space that means only 2GB ram available to your process if it is 32-bit. 

Ok even if we have 2 GB, but I still have 1.2 GB to go. Not quite! If your process is a .NET process, then the managed memory is splitted in several sections. 
Whenever the garbage collector triggers, it will defragment the memory for you, so that the managed memory allocated is a single piece if we exclude the pinned items. 
But there is one section called **Large Object Heap** which larger objects are put (since defragmenting larger objects are put there. And by default this section is not fragmented.
As a result, it is possible that we could have a chese like memory with lot of small holes. We could have 1.2 GB Ram but if the largest space available in our
