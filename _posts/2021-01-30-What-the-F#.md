# What the F#!

In a previous [post](https://onurgumus.github.io/2020/12/26/Functional-Programming.html) I have explained my motivations about functional programming.
It's no secret I love F# and find it extremely underrated. In this post I would like to discuss different aspects of F#.

## F# is independent from .NET 

F# is mostly known to community as small ignored brother of C# running on .net platform. However what is less known about F# is that it
has come to a maturity level to be .NET independent. Thanks to Fable, today F# can be considered as a complete replacement of TypeScript. Yes
people do write full blown applications SPA, React, Svelte applications by using F# instead of TypeScript. There is also a new target for Fable
that can transpile to Python. It also works as on WebAssembly with Bolero. I would say this is a unique reason to F#. Just like JavaScript people
were using node to bring the front end devs to the backend zone, F# is also can be used to bring your backend devs to the front end. You can practically share 
your code between your .NET/Node backend and the one runs in the browser, giving you isomorphic development experience. 

This is somewhat put's F# to an interesting position as historically most dotnet has been languages are managed by Microsoft. But Fable simply liberates
F# from Microsoft and .NET.

## FSharp fanboys

There is some chance you might have heard "one of those guys" who is talking how great functional programming and/or F#. And from that point
the below picture summarizes the situation




However let's look at from the other side and this is how an F# developer feels when he is suggesting you F#


## Microsoft's and communitie's stance
